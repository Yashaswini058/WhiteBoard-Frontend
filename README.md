This is the **React frontend** for the Collaborative Whiteboard project.
It provides a real-time interactive drawing interface, board management, and user collaboration features powered by **Socket.IO** and the backend API.

## 🔌 Socket.IO Protocol (Frontend Integration)

The frontend listens and emits the following socket events:

### Presence & Cursors

* `board:join` / `board:leave` – join or leave a board room
* `presence:join` / `presence:leave` – track collaborators
* `cursor` – send/receive live cursor position

### Drawing Lifecycle

* `element:start` – begin a new drawing element
* `element:points` – stream drawing points
* `element:update` – live patches (transformations)
* `element:commit` – persist element to DB and get finalId
* `element:erase` – remove elements
